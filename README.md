### MINI POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM
#**PROJECT OVERVIEW**:
The "Mini Pollution Monitoring System" is a Python-based project that simulates real-time pollution monitoring in different environments such as indoors,outdoors, and traffic areas.
It detects pollution levels, categorizes them(LOW/MODERATE/HIGH), and if levels are HIGH- asks the user whether to turn ON a purifier or not.
The Project has 5 Modules-
1. Sensor Module 
2. Select_activity Module
3. Analyzer Module
4. Action_required Module
5. Report Module
Main Module


#**FEATURES**:
1. Choose environment activity?location(Traffic Area, Indoors, Kitchen, Park, Factory or Custom location).
2. Simulated sensor readings (PM2.5, AQI and CO2).
3. Automatic air quality analysis based on AQI.
4. Dynamic safety recommendations.
5. Also timestamp added for each reading.
6. Multiple testing based on loop(Run-again option).
7. Easy to understand and modular code structure.

#**TECNOLOGIES/TOOLS USED**:
1. Python 3.x
2. Built-in module:
     datetime(for timestamp)
3. No external libraries required.
4. Works on:
     1. VS Code
     2. PyCharm
     3. IDLE
     4. Any Python environment

#**STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN THE PROJECT**:
1. Install Python:
     Download and install Python(if not) - https://www.python.org/downloads/
     Make sure to check "Add to PATH" while installing.
2. Download the Project Folder. 
3. Open the Project using any editor(Install if not already installed):
     1. VS Code
     2. PyCharm
     3. IDLE
     4. Any else 
4. Run the Prgram:
     Method A: Using Terminal - Open a terminal in the Project folder and run:
                python main.py
     Method B: Using run button - In VS Code/IDLE/PyCharm:
                click Run        

#**INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING**:
To test the project:
1. Run the program.
2. Select a location(1-6).
3. Input the sensor readings.
4. You will see the Air Quality Status. Check that.
5. Follow the recommended action.
6. You can choose yes when asked:
    Do you want to run again(YES/NO)?:
to test multiple times.
