### MINI POLLUTION MONITORING SYSTEM
#**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:
Air Pollution is a growing environmental and public health concern. People are often unaware of the pollution levels in their surroundings- whether indoors, outdoors, in traffic, factories, kitchens, or other locations.
There is a need for a simple system that can:
1. Monitor Air Quality
2. Analyze pollution levels
3. Provide meaningful allerts.
4. Suggest safety actions.

#**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**:
The project focuses on simulating an air quality monitoring system using Python. It does not use physical sensors, instead, it uses predefined pollution profiles for different environments.
The scope includes:
1. Selecting a location(eg.- traffic, indoor, kitchen, park, factory or custom).
2. Generating simulated sensor readings(PM2.5, CO2, AQI)
3. Analyzing pollution levels based on AQI standards.
4. Providing recommendations or warnings to the user.
5. Asking user permission to turn ON the air purifier when air quality is poor.
6. Displaying a complete air quality report.

The project is entirely based on console-based and uses only Python's standard library.

#**TARGET USERS**:
1. STUDENTS: Those who want to learn Python and understand how modular programming works.
2. AWARENESS GROUPS: People who want a basic pollution-monitoring concept demonstration.

#**HIGH LEVEL FEATURES**:
1. ENVIRONMENT SELECTION: User can choose different locations like traffic area, indoors, factory, park, kitchen or any custom location.
2. SIMULATED SENSOR READINGS: Displays values for- PM2.5, AQI and CO2.
3. AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS: Determines whether the air quality is-
Good
Moderate
Very Unhealthy
Hazardous
4. ACTION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM: Provides warning and suggestions. Ask the user for turning ON the purifier.
5. AUTOMATIC REPORT GENERATION
6. REPEATABLE MONITORING: User can run the system multiple times in one session.
